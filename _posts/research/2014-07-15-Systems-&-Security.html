	  <h3>RDMA Side-Channel Attack</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
RDMA is a technology
that allows direct access from the network to a
machine’s main memory without involving its CPU.
While RDMA provides massive
performance boosts and has thus been adopted by
several major cloud providers, security concerns have
so far been neglected.
</p>
<p>
The need for RDMA NICs to bypass CPU and directly
access memory result in them storing various metadata
like page table entries in their on-board SRAM. When
the SRAM is full, RNICs swap metadata to main memory
across the PCIe bus. We exploited the resulting timing
difference to establish side channels and demonstrated
that these side channels can leak access patterns of victim
nodes to other nodes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Pythia</b> is a set of RDMA-based remote sidechannel
attacks that allow an attacker on one machine to
learn how victims on other machines access the server’s
exported in-memory data. We reverse engineered the memory
architecture of the most widely used RDMA NIC
and use this knowledge to improve the efficiency of
Pythia. We further extended Pythia to build side-channel
attacks on Crail, a real RDMA-based key-value store application.
<!--We evaluated Pythia on four different RDMA
NICs both in a laboratory and in a public cloud setting.-->
Pythia is fast (57μs), accurate (97% accuracy), and can
hide all its traces from the victim or the server.

	  <h3>Security Implications of One-Sided Communication</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
One-sided network communication technologies such as RDMA, Gen-Z, 
and NVMe-over-Fabrics are quickly gaining adoption in production software and datacenters. 
Although appealing for their low CPU utilization and good performance, 
they raise new security concerns that have never been looked into before. 
</p>
<p>
We identified various security implications of one-sided communication. 
In addition to security threats, 
we further discover opportunities of leveraging one-sided communication to enhance security, 
showing that one-sided communication is indeed a double-edged sword in security.

	  <h3>Cloud for Safe IoT File Systems</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Smart devices produce security-sensitive data and keep them in on-device storage for persistence. The current storage stack on smart devices, however, offers weak security guarantees: not only because the stack depends on a vulnerable commodity OS, but also because smart device deployment is known weak on security measures. 
</p>
<p>
To safeguard such data on smart devices, we present a novel storage stack architecture that i) protects file data in a trusted execution environment (TEE); ii) outsources file system logic and metadata out of TEE; iii) running a metadata-only file system replica in the cloud for continuously verifying the on-device file system behaviors. To realize the architecture, we build Overwatch, aTrustZone-based storage stack. Overwatch addresses unique challenges including discerning metadata at fine grains, hiding network delays, and coping with cloud disconnection. On a suite of three real-world applications, Overwatch shows moderate security overheads.
