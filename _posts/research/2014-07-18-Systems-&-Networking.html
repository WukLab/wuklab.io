	  <h3>Network for Resource Disaggregation</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
The need to access remote resources and to access them fast demands a new network system for future disaggregated datacenters.
We are building <b>LegoNET</b>, a new network system designed for adding disaggregated resources to 
existing datacenters in a non-disruptive way, while delivering low-latency, high-throughput performance 
and a flexible, easy-to-use interface.

	  <h3>RDMA Side-Channel Attack</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
RDMA is a technology
that allows direct access from the network to a
machine’s main memory without involving its CPU.
While RDMA provides massive
performance boosts and has thus been adopted by
several major cloud providers, security concerns have
so far been neglected.
</p>
<p>
The need for RDMA NICs to bypass CPU and directly
access memory result in them storing various metadata
like page table entries in their on-board SRAM. When
the SRAM is full, RNICs swap metadata to main memory
across the PCIe bus. We exploited the resulting timing
difference to establish side channels and demonstrated
that these side channels can leak access patterns of victim
nodes to other nodes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Pythia</b> is a set of RDMA-based remote sidechannel
attacks that allow an attacker on one machine to
learn how victims on other machines access the server’s
exported in-memory data. We reverse engineered the memory
architecture of the most widely used RDMA NIC
and use this knowledge to improve the efficiency of
Pythia. We further extended Pythia to build side-channel
attacks on Crail, a real RDMA-based key-value store application.
<!--We evaluated Pythia on four different RDMA
NICs both in a laboratory and in a public cloud setting.-->
Pythia is fast (57μs), accurate (97% accuracy), and can
hide all its traces from the victim or the server.

	  <h3>Datacenter Approximate Tranmission Protocol</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Many datacenter applications such as machine learning
and streaming systems do not need the complete set of
data to perform their computation. Current approximate
applications in datacenters run on a reliable network
layer like TCP and either sample data before sending or 
drop data after receiving to improve performance. 
These approaches are network oblivious and 
transmit (and retransmit) more data than necessary, 
affecting both application
runtime and network bandwidth usage. 
<!--
Running approximate
application on a lossy network with UDP cannot
guarantee the accuracy of application computation.
-->
</p>
<p>
We propose to run approximate applications on a lossy
network and to allow packet loss in a controlled manner.
We designed a new network protocol
called Approximate Transmission Protocol, or <strong>ATP</strong>, 
for datacenter approximate applications. ATP opportunistically
exploits available network bandwidth as much as
possible, while performing a loss-based rate control algorithm
to avoid bandwidth waste and retransmission.
It also ensures bandwidth fair sharing across flows and
improves accurate applications’ performance by leaving
more switch buffer space to accurate flows.

	  <h3>Kernel-Level Indirection Layer for RDMA</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Recently, there is an increasing interest in building datacenter
applications with RDMA because of its low-latency,
high-throughput, and low-CPU-utilization benefits. However,
RDMAis not readily suitable for datacenter applications.
It lacks a flexible, high-level abstraction; its performance
does not scale; and it does not provide resource sharing or
flexible protection. Because of these issues, it is difficult to
build RDMA-based applications and to exploit RDMA’s performance
benefits.
</p>
<p>
To solve these issues, we built <strong>LITE</strong>, a Local Indirection
TiEr for RDMA in the Linux kernel that virtualizes native
RDMA into a flexible, high-level, easy-to-use abstraction
and allows applications to safely share resources. Despite
the widely-held belief that kernel bypassing is essential to
RDMA’s low-latency performance, we show that using a
kernel-level indirection can achieve both flexibility and lowlatency,
scalable performance at the same time.
