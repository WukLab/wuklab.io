summary: The traditional datacenter monolithic-server architecture and the software systems built on top of it are meeting their limitations in the face of new hardware and software trends. Our vision of the next-generation datacenter is to break the monolithic server boundary, an approach called resource disaggregation.

Datacenters have been using a monolithic server model for decades, where each server has a motherboard that hosts all types of hardware resources, usually including a processor, memory chips, storage devices, and network cards.
This monolithic architecture is easy to deploy but is inflexible in terms of resource utilization,
new hardware device integration, and failure handling.
We are looking into new ways to rethink datacenter hardware and software systems,
including disaggregated hardware architecture, disaggregated operating system,
remote memory (and non-volatile memory) systems,
and distributed (non-volatile) memory systems.

	  <h3>Hardware-Based Disaggregated Memory Services</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">

We are building a hardware platform which provides disaggregated and distributed memory services
to both existing datacenter servers and disaggregated processors.
Our hardware-based disaggregated memory services can be accessed by virtual memory interface,
key-value store interface, and other customized interfaces.
Stay tuned for more details.

	  <h3>Network for Resource Disaggregation</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
The need to access remote resources and to access them fast demands a new network system for future disaggregated datacenters.
We are building <b>LegoNET</b>, a new network system designed for adding disaggregated resources to
existing datacenters in a non-disruptive way, while delivering low-latency, high-throughput performance
and a flexible, easy-to-use interface.

The monolithic server model where a server is the unit
of deployment, operation, and failure is meeting its limits
in the face of several recent hardware
and application trends.
To improve resource utilization,
elasticity, heterogeneity,
and failure handling in datacenters, we believe
that datacenters should break monolithic servers
into disaggregated, network-attached hardware components.
Despite the promising benefits of hardware resource
disaggregation, no existing OSes or software systems
can properly manage it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
       <div class="span6">
<p>
We propose a new OS model called the splitkernel to
manage disaggregated systems. Splitkernel disseminates
traditional OS functionalities into loosely-coupled monitors,
each of which runs on and manages a hardware
component. A splitkernel also performs resource allocation
and failure handling of a distributed set of hardware
components. Using the splitkernel model, we built
LegoOS, a new OS designed for hardware resource disaggregation.
LegoOS appears to users as a set of distributed
servers. Internally, a user application can span
multiple processor, memory, and storage hardware components.
We implemented LegoOS on x86-64 and evaluated
it by emulating hardware components using commodity
servers. Our evaluation results show that LegoOS’
performance is comparable to monolithic Linux
servers, while largely improving resource packing and
reducing failure rate over monolithic clusters.

	  <h3>Disaggregated Persistent Memory</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
One viable approach to deploy persistent memory (PM) in datacenters
is to attach PM as self-contained devices to the network as disaggregated
persistent memory, or <b>DPM</b>. DPM requires no changes
to existing servers in datacenters; without the need to
include a processor, DPM devices are cheap to build;
and by sharing DPM across compute servers, they offer
great elasticity and efficient resource packing.
</p>
<p>
We propose three architectures of DPM: 1) compute nodes
directly access DPM (DPM-Direct); 2) compute nodes
send requests to a coordinator server, which then accesses
DPM to complete a request (DPM-Central); and
3) compute nodes directly access DPM for data operations
and communicate with a global metadata server for
the control plane (DPM-Sep). Based on these architectures,
we built three atomic, crash-consistent data stores.

	  <h3>Kernel-Level Indirection Layer for RDMA</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Recently, there is an increasing interest in building datacenter
applications with RDMA because of its low-latency,
high-throughput, and low-CPU-utilization benefits. However,
RDMAis not readily suitable for datacenter applications.
It lacks a flexible, high-level abstraction; its performance
does not scale; and it does not provide resource sharing or
flexible protection. Because of these issues, it is difficult to
build RDMA-based applications and to exploit RDMA’s performance
benefits.
</p>
<p>
To solve these issues, we built <strong>LITE</strong>, a Local Indirection
TiEr for RDMA in the Linux kernel that virtualizes native
RDMA into a flexible, high-level, easy-to-use abstraction
and allows applications to safely share resources. Despite
the widely-held belief that kernel bypassing is essential to
RDMA’s low-latency performance, we show that using a
kernel-level indirection can achieve both flexibility and lowlatency,
scalable performance at the same time.

NVMs have the potential to greatly
improve the performance and reliability of large-scale
applications in datacenters.
However, it is still unclear how to best utilize them
in distributed, datacenter environments.
</p>
</div>

<p>
We introduce Distributed Shared Persistent Memory
(DSPM), a new framework for using persistent memories
in distributed datacenter environments. DSPM provides
a new abstraction that allows applications to both perform
traditional memory load and store instructions and
to name, share, and persist their data. We built <strong>Hotpot</strong>,
a kernel-level DSPM system that provides low-latency,
transparent memory accesses, data persistence, data reliability,
and high availability.
