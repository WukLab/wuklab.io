summary: building next-generation serverless datacenters

<p>
Datacenters have been using a “monolithic” server model for decades, 
where each server hosts a set of hardware devices like CPU and DRAM 
and runs an OS or hypervisor on top to manage the hardware resources. 
In recent years, cloud providers offer a type of service called “serverless computing” in response to cloud users’ desires for not managing clusters and for auto-scaling their applications to the
right size. 
Serverless computing quickly gained popularity, but today’s serverless computing still runs on servers. 
The monolithic server model is not the best fit for serverless computing and 
it fundamentally restricts datacenters from achieving efficient resource packing, hardware rightsizing, and great heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>
We propose to fully or partially “disaggregate” monolithic servers into network-attached hardware 
components that host different hardware resources and offer different functionalities 
(e.g., a computation pool for running application logics,
a memory pool for enlarged and consolidated memory spaces, 
a persistent-memory pool for fast accesses to key-value data).
With such a “serverless” datacenter, hardware resources can be allocated and scaled to the exact amount that applications use and can be individually managed and customized for different application needs.
WukLab is taking piorneering efforts in building end-to-end, multi-layer solutions for 
the next-generation serverless datacenter, including new hardware platforms, a new operating system,
new distributed systems, a new virtualization platform, new networking systems, 
and new security solutions.

	  <h3>Disaggregating Network Tasks: A Consolidation Approach with NetPool</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Servers in today's data centers host software and hardware resources for processing network packets. Managing and executing network tasks at each end host can be costly both in
capital cost and engineering effort. We propose to disaggregate network resources from end hosts to a separate
network resource pool. We propose <b>NetPool</b>, a distributed SmartNIC platform that pools together at the rack scale. 
Each SmartNIC in NetPool consolidates network functionalities from multiple endpoints by fairly sharing limited hardware resources, and it achieves its
performance goals with an auto-scaled, highly parallel data plane and a scalable control plane.

	  <h3>Disaggregation and Program Behavior: A Static-Runtime-Codesign Approach with Mira</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Far memory, where memory accesses go to memory on remote servers, has become more popular in recent years as a solution to expand memory size and avoid memory stranding. Prior far memory systems have taken two approaches: transparently swap memory pages between local and far memory, and utilizing new programming models to move fine-grained data between local and far memory. The former requires no program changes but comes with performance penalty, while the latter requires significant program changes, though with increased performance.
		</p>
          <p>
We propose a far-memory system that co-designs static program analysis and compilation with run-time systems, called Mira. Mira utilizes program analysis results, profiled execution information, and system environments together to guide code compilation and system configurations for far memory. Our evaluation shows that Mira outperforms prior swap-based and programming-model-based systems up to 18 times.

	  <h3>Disaggregating Serverless Computing: A Resource-Centric Approach with Scad</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Today’s serverless computing has several key limitations including per-function resource limits, fixed CPU-to-memory ratio, and constant resource allocation throughout a function execution and across different invocations of it. The root cause of these limitations is the “function-centric” model: a function is a fixed-size box that is allocated, executed, and terminated as an inseparable unit. This unit is pre-defined by the cloud provider and cannot properly capture user needs.
		</p>
          <p>
We propose a “resource-centric” model for serverless computing that captures fine-grained resource needs throughout an application’s execution using components of distinct resource type, amount, and time span. We build a new resource-based serverless execution platform that executes components in a disaggregated, on-demand, and auto-scaled manner. Our results show that Scad reduces resource consumption by 40% to 84% compared to OpenWhisk while only adding 1.3% performance overhead. Compared to PyWren, Scad even achieves 15% to 28% speedup while reducing resource consumption by 16% to 31%.

	  <h3>Disaggregating Memory: A Hardware Aproach with Clio</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Memory disaggregation has attracted great attention recently
because of its benefits in efficient memory utilization and
ease of management. So far, memory disaggregation research has all taken one of two approaches, building/emulating memory nodes with either regular servers or raw memory
devices with no processing power. The former incurs higher
monetary cost and face tail latency and scalability limitations, while the latter introduce performance, security, and
management problems.
		</p>
          <p>
We seek a sweet spot in the middle of these two extremes by proposing, for the first time, a hardware-based
memory disaggregation solution that has the right amount
of processing power at memory nodes. 
We built a hardware-based disaggregated memory system called <b>Clio</b>, which 
virtualizes and manages disaggregated memory at the memory node. Clio includes a new hardware-based
virtual memory system, a customized network system, and a
framework for computation offloading. In building Clio, we
not only co-design OS functionalities, hardware architecture,
and the network system, but also co-design the compute node
and memory node. We prototyped Clio’s memory node with
FPGA and implemented its client-node functionalities in a
user-space library. Clio achieves 100 Gbps throughput and
an end-to-end latency of 2.5 µs at median and 3.2 µs at the
99th percentile. Clio scales much better and has orders of
magnitude lower tail latency than RDMA, and it has 1.1× to
3.4× energy saving compared to CPU-based and SmartNICbased disaggregated memory systems and is 2.7× faster than
software-based SmartNIC solutions.

	  <h3>Disaggregating Persistent Memory: A Passive Approach with Clover</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Existing disaggregated storage systems use hard disks or SSDs as storage media. Recently,
the technology of persistent memory (PM) has matured and
seen initial adoption in several datacenters. Disaggregating
PM could enjoy the same benefits of traditional disaggregated storage systems, but it requires new designs because
of its memory-like performance and byte addressability.
</p>
<p>
We explore the design of disaggregating PM and managing them remotely from compute servers, a
model we call passive disaggregated persistent memory, or <b>pDPM</b>. 
Compared to the alternative of managing PM at storage servers, pDPM significantly lowers monetary and energy
costs and avoids scalability bottlenecks at storage servers.
We built three key-value store systems using the pDPM
model. The first one lets all compute nodes directly access
and manage storage nodes. The second uses a central coordinator to orchestrate the communication between compute
and storage nodes. These two systems have various performance and scalability limitations. To solve these problems,
we built <b>Clover</b>, a pDPM system that separates the location,
communication mechanism, and management strategy of the
data plane and the metadata/control plane. Compute nodes
access storage nodes directly for data operations, while one
or few global metadata servers handle all metadata/control
operations. From our extensive evaluation of the three pDPM
systems, we found Clover to be the best-performing pDPM
system. Its performance under common datacenter workloads is similar to non-pDPM remote in-memory key-value
store, while reducing CapEx and OpEx by 1.4× and 3.9×.

The monolithic server model where a server is the unit
of deployment, operation, and failure is meeting its limits
in the face of several recent hardware
and application trends.
To improve resource utilization,
elasticity, heterogeneity,
and failure handling in datacenters, we believe
that datacenters should break monolithic servers
into disaggregated, network-attached hardware components.
Despite the promising benefits of hardware resource
disaggregation, no existing OSes or software systems
can properly manage it.
</p>

<p>
We propose a new OS model called the splitkernel to
manage disaggregated systems. Splitkernel disseminates
traditional OS functionalities into loosely-coupled monitors,
each of which runs on and manages a hardware
component. A splitkernel also performs resource allocation
and failure handling of a distributed set of hardware
components. Using the splitkernel model, we built
LegoOS, a new OS designed for hardware resource disaggregation.
LegoOS appears to users as a set of distributed
servers. Internally, a user application can span
multiple processor, memory, and storage hardware components.
We implemented LegoOS on x86-64 and evaluated
it by emulating hardware components using commodity
servers. Our evaluation results show that LegoOS’
performance is comparable to monolithic Linux
servers, while largely improving resource packing and
reducing failure rate over monolithic clusters.
