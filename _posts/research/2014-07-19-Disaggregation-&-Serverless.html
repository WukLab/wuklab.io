summary: building next-generation serverless datacenters

<p>
Datacenters have been using a “monolithic” server model for decades, 
where each server hosts a set of hardware devices like CPU and DRAM 
and runs an OS or hypervisor on top to manage the hardware resources. 
In recent years, cloud providers offer a type of service called “serverless computing” in response to cloud users’ desires for not managing clusters and for auto-scaling their applications to the
right size. 
Serverless computing quickly gained popularity, but today’s serverless computing still runs on servers. 
The monolithic server model is not the best fit for serverless computing and 
it fundamentally restricts datacenters from achieving efficient resource packing, hardware rightsizing, and great heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>
We propose to fully or partially “disaggregate” monolithic servers into network-attached hardware 
components that host different hardware resources and offer different functionalities 
(e.g., a computation pool for running application logics,
a memory pool for enlarged and consolidated memory spaces, 
a persistent-memory pool for fast accesses to key-value data).
With such a “serverless” datacenter, hardware resources can be allocated and scaled to the exact amount that applications use and can be individually managed and customized for different application needs.
WukLab is taking piorneering efforts in building end-to-end, multi-layer solutions for 
the next-generation serverless datacenter, including new hardware platforms, a new operating system,
new distributed systems, a new virtualization platform, new networking systems, 
and new security solutions.

	  <h3>Serverless Computing on Disaggregated Resources</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">

We are building a new serverless-computing platform on disaggregated resource clusters.
Users can write functions just like traditional POSIX-compatible programs,
with the additional support from our platform for managing application "states",
IPC-like communication across functions,
and improved security and QoS guarantees.

	  <h3>Hardware-Based Disaggregated Memory Services</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">

We are building a hardware platform which provides disaggregated and distributed memory services
to both existing datacenter servers and disaggregated processors.
Our hardware-based disaggregated memory services can be accessed by virtual memory interface,
key-value store interface, and other customized interfaces.

	  <h3>Network for Resource Disaggregation</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
The need to access remote resources and to access them fast demands a new network system for future disaggregated datacenters.
We are building <b>LegoNET</b>, a new network system designed for adding disaggregated resources to
existing datacenters in a non-disruptive way, while delivering low-latency, high-throughput performance
and a flexible, easy-to-use interface.

The monolithic server model where a server is the unit
of deployment, operation, and failure is meeting its limits
in the face of several recent hardware
and application trends.
To improve resource utilization,
elasticity, heterogeneity,
and failure handling in datacenters, we believe
that datacenters should break monolithic servers
into disaggregated, network-attached hardware components.
Despite the promising benefits of hardware resource
disaggregation, no existing OSes or software systems
can properly manage it.

<p>
We propose a new OS model called the splitkernel to
manage disaggregated systems. Splitkernel disseminates
traditional OS functionalities into loosely-coupled monitors,
each of which runs on and manages a hardware
component. A splitkernel also performs resource allocation
and failure handling of a distributed set of hardware
components. Using the splitkernel model, we built
LegoOS, a new OS designed for hardware resource disaggregation.
LegoOS appears to users as a set of distributed
servers. Internally, a user application can span
multiple processor, memory, and storage hardware components.
We implemented LegoOS on x86-64 and evaluated
it by emulating hardware components using commodity
servers. Our evaluation results show that LegoOS’
performance is comparable to monolithic Linux
servers, while largely improving resource packing and
reducing failure rate over monolithic clusters.

	  <h3>Disaggregated Persistent Memory</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
One viable approach to deploy persistent memory (PM) in datacenters
is to attach PM as self-contained devices to the network as disaggregated
persistent memory, or <b>DPM</b>. DPM requires no changes
to existing servers in datacenters; without the need to
include a processor, DPM devices are cheap to build;
and by sharing DPM across compute servers, they offer
great elasticity and efficient resource packing.
</p>
<p>
We propose three architectures of DPM: 1) compute nodes
directly access DPM (DPM-Direct); 2) compute nodes
send requests to a coordinator server, which then accesses
DPM to complete a request (DPM-Central); and
3) compute nodes directly access DPM for data operations
and communicate with a global metadata server for
the control plane (DPM-Sep). Based on these architectures,
we built three atomic, crash-consistent data stores.

	  <h3>Indirection Layer for RDMA</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Recently, there is an increasing interest in building datacenter
applications with RDMA because of its low-latency,
high-throughput, and low-CPU-utilization benefits. However,
RDMA is not readily suitable for datacenter applications.
It lacks a flexible, high-level abstraction; its performance
does not scale; and it does not provide resource sharing or
flexible protection. Because of these issues, it is difficult to
build RDMA-based applications and to exploit RDMA’s performance
benefits.
</p>
<p>
To solve these issues, we built <strong>LITE</strong>, a Local Indirection
TiEr for RDMA that virtualizes native
RDMA into a flexible, high-level, easy-to-use abstraction
and allows applications to safely share resources. 
	  <!--
Despite
the widely-held belief that kernel bypassing is essential to
RDMA’s low-latency performance, we show that using a
kernel-level indirection can achieve both flexibility and lowlatency,
scalable performance at the same time.
