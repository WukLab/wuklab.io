<p>
Modern machine-learning and artificial intelligence problems are not (only) algorithmetic ones
but (also) systems ones.
We are seeking solutions for both building better systems for ML/AI 
and using ML/AI to build systems.

<h3>Using ML to Build OS</h3>
<div class="span6">
<p class="text-left">
With operating systems being at the core of computer systems, decades of research and engineering efforts have been
put into the development of OSes. To keep pace with the
speed of modern hardware and application evolvement, we
argue that a different approach should be taken in future OS
development. Instead of relying solely on human wisdom, we
should also leverage AI and machine learning techniques to
automatically “learn” how to build and tune an OS. This paper
explores the opportunities and challenges of the “learned” OS
approach and makes recommendation for future researchers
and practitioners on building such an OS.
