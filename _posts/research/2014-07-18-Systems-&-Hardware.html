<!--With the end of Dennard Scaling and the slowing of Moore's law,-->
Systems and hardware closely interact with each other.
WukLab is taking non-traditional approaches to "building systems" and "building hardware"
in response to new hardware and software trends.
We build systems on new types of hardware like non-volatile memory;
we design new hardware architectures for new software trends;
we build systems like OSes in hardware;
and we improve hardware experiences with software flexibility.

	  <h3>Disaggregating and Consolidating Network Functionalities with SuperNIC</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
We, for the first
time, demonstrate how to disaggregate network resources by
proposing a new distributed hardware framework called <b>SuperNIC</b>. 
Each SuperNIC connects a small set of endpoints
and consolidates network functionalities for these endpoints.
We prototyped SuperNIC with FPGA and demonstrate its
performance and cost benefits with real network functions
and customized disaggregated applications.

	  <h3>Disaggregating Memory: A Hardware Aproach with Clio</h3>
          <div class="span6">
        	<p class="text-left">
Memory disaggregation has attracted great attention recently
because of its benefits in efficient memory utilization and
ease of management. So far, memory disaggregation research has all taken one of two approaches, building/emulating memory nodes with either regular servers or raw memory
devices with no processing power. The former incurs higher
monetary cost and face tail latency and scalability limitations, while the latter introduce performance, security, and
management problems.
		</p>
          <p>
We seek a sweet spot in the middle of these two extremes by proposing, for the first time, a hardware-based
memory disaggregation solution that has the right amount
of processing power at memory nodes. 
We built a hardware-based disaggregated memory system called <b>Clio</b>, which 
virtualizes and manages disaggregated memory at the memory node. Clio includes a new hardware-based
virtual memory system, a customized network system, and a
framework for computation offloading. In building Clio, we
not only co-design OS functionalities, hardware architecture,
and the network system, but also co-design the compute node
and memory node. We prototyped Clio’s memory node with
FPGA and implemented its client-node functionalities in a
user-space library. Clio achieves 100 Gbps throughput and
an end-to-end latency of 2.5 µs at median and 3.2 µs at the
99th percentile. Clio scales much better and has orders of
magnitude lower tail latency than RDMA, and it has 1.1× to
3.4× energy saving compared to CPU-based and SmartNICbased disaggregated memory systems and is 2.7× faster than
software-based SmartNIC solutions.

NVMs have the potential to greatly
improve the performance and reliability of large-scale
applications in datacenters.
However, it is still unclear how to best utilize them
in distributed, datacenter environments.

We introduce Distributed Shared Persistent Memory
(DSPM), a new framework for using persistent memories
in distributed datacenter environments. DSPM provides
a new abstraction that allows applications to both perform
traditional memory load and store instructions and
to name, share, and persist their data. We built <strong>Hotpot</strong>,
a kernel-level DSPM system that provides low-latency,
transparent memory accesses, data persistence, data reliability,
and high availability.

    <h3>Reliable and Highly-Available NVMM</h3>
          <div class="span6">

        <p>
        NVMM would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments,
        where reliability and availability are critical.
        However, providing reliability and availability to NVMM is challenging,
        since the latency of data replication can squander the low latency that NVMM can provide.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Mojim</strong> is a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require,
        while preserving the performance of NVMM.
        Mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains
        a mirrored pair of nodes
        and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data.
        Mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks.
        Our evaluation results show that surprisingly Mojim provides replicated NVMM with similar or even better performance than un-replicated NVMM
        (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 and 2.7X the throughput).
        Mojim also outperforms MongoDB's replication system by 3.4 to 4X.
